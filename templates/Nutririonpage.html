It is also a good source of protein, providing all essential amino acids needed for tissue repair and growth. Additionally, milk is rich in vitamins, including vitamin D for calcium absorption and vitamin A for vision. Milk contains vital minerals like phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium, supporting various bodily functions. Its high water content aids in maintaining proper hydration. The fat content in milk varies depending on the type, from whole milk to skim milk. Lactose, a natural sugar in milk, serves as an energy source.'
